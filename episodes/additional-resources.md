## Additional resources

If you want to learn more about image processing and microscopy, we've linked 
some useful resources below: 

### Bioimage analysis
- [image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/)  
A general forum for image analysis advice, covering many popular pieces of 
software e.g. ImageJ, Napari, QuPath and many more.

- [Pete Bankhead's bioimage book](https://bioimagebook.github.io/)  
A free, online book providing in-depth discussion of biological image analysis. 
A great resource for delving deeper into the principles discussed during this 
course.

- [Data Carpentry: Image Processing with Python course
](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/)  
An online course covering image analysis with python. This is particularly 
useful if you want to start writing your own scripts to use with Napari.

- [Bioimaging guide](https://www.bioimagingguide.org)  
An online guide covering principles for design of quantitative microscopy 
experiments, as well as how to analyse the resulting image data.

- [Robert Haase's lectures on bioimage analysis
](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ESQNfM5lc7SAMstEu082ivW4BDMvd0U)    
Recordings of Robert Haase's 2020 lectures on bioimage analysis. Useful for 
learning general image processing principles, in various pieces of software 
e.g. ImageJ, python, QuPath...

### Napari
