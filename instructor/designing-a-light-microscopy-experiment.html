<p>In previous episodes we focused on the fundamentals of how images are
stored and displayed, with Napari as our main example. In the next few
episodes, we will instead focus on how to design an experiment using
light microscopy and how to analyse the resulting image data.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="steps-to-designing-a-light-microscopy-experiment">Steps to designing a light microscopy experiment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#steps-to-designing-a-light-microscopy-experiment"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>As we’ve said throughout the course, there is no one ‘right’ way of
analysing image data. It depends on the specific images and research
question, with different solutions being best for different situations.
The same holds true for designing a light microscopy experiment - here
we’ll discuss some general guidelines, but the specifics will depend on
your particular research project.</p>
<p>For the sake of this episode, let’s imagine a scenario where we are
investigating the effects of a specific chemical on cells grown in
culture. What steps would we take to design a light microscopy
experiment for this?</p>
<p>A general workflow could be:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li><p>Define your research question</p></li>
<li><p>Define what you need to observe to answer that question</p></li>
<li><p>Define what you need to measure to answer that question</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a light microscopy method that fits your data
needs</p></li>
<li><p>Choose acquisition settings that fit your data needs</p></li>
</ol></section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="define-your-research-question">Define your research question<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#define-your-research-question"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Clearly defining your research question is the essential starting
point. What do you want to find out from your microscopy experiment?</p>
<p>For our chemical example, the main aim could be: Does the chemical
affect the number, size or shape of cell nuclei over time?</p>
<p>Then we could form more specific research questions e.g.</p>
<ul><li><p>Does the addition of the chemical result in an increase in the
number of cell nuclei over ten hours?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the addition of the chemical result in an increase in the
average nucleus diameter over ten hours?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the addition of the chemical result in an increase in the
roundness of cell nuclei over ten hours?</p></li>
</ul><p>For the rest of the episode, we will stick to our very broad research
aim of: ‘Does the chemical affect the number, size or shape of cell
nuclei over time?’. This will allow us to have a broad discussion of
many different approaches to designing a light microscopy experiment.

</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="fluorescent-labels">Fluorescent labels<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fluorescent-labels"></a></h3>
<p>We will probably need a fluorescent label for the nuclei. This will
allow them to be easily identified in our images so the number, size and
shape can be measured.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible to see and measure nuclei from un-labelled
cells also (e.g. from phase contrast or DIC images, as we will cover in
the <a href="#widefield">widefield section of this episode</a>). The
downside is that it’s much harder to automatically recognise and measure
nuclei from these kinds of images. Unlike images of fluorescently
labelled nuclei, there is a much less clear separation between nuclei
and the rest of the cell, making analysis more challenging.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="spatial-scale">Spatial scale<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatial-scale"></a></h3>
<p>We need to observe many nuclei at once, to get a good estimate of
their number and average shape and size. Therefore, our spatial scale
should encompass an area large enough to image many nuclei for each
timepoint (say 100 nuclei).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="timescale">Timescale<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#timescale"></a></h3>
<p>As we are interested in how the nuclei number, shape and size changes
over time, we will need to use live cell imaging. We will need to image
for long enough to see multiple cell divisions, so we can assess how the
number of nuclei increases. The length of time required will depend on
the cell line you are using, as they each take a different length of
time to divide.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="d-or-3d">2D or 3D<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#d-or-3d"></a></h3>
<p>This will depend on how we want to measure nucleus size and shape (as
we’ll look at in the next section of this episode). For example, if we
want to accurately characterise the volume and 3D shape of the nuclei
then we will need to image in 3D. If we’re instead happy to estimate
from 2D measures like nucleus diameter, then 2D is sufficient. This
again highlights the need for a specific research question! In a real
life experiment, we should probably define more clearly exactly what
aspects of nucleus size and shape we are interested in, as this will
help to inform the need for 2D or 3D.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p>Once we have a good idea of what we need to observe, we need to
clearly define what measurements are required.</p>
<ul><li><p>What do you need to quantify from your images to answer your
question? E.g. cell length, nucleus volume, the number of cells with a
specific fluorescent label…</p></li>
<li><p>How will you quantify them? E.g. which image processing software?
What kind of analysis methods?</p></li>
<li><p>How many objects/events do you need to quantify?</p></li>
</ul><p>As the second point indicates, it’s always worthwhile to consider how
you will quantify your images before you collect them. This will make
the image analysis steps much faster and ensure that you are collecting
images optimised for the given method. We’ll look at image processing
methods more in later episodes.</p>
<p>For the last point, it’s important to consider any statistical tests
you will use to answer your research question, and the sample size
required to give them sufficient statistical ‘power’. Statistical power
is the likelihood of a statistical test detecting an effect when one is
actually present. For example, consider testing if there is a difference
of X% in the number of cells when grown with and without our chemical of
interest. If there really is a difference, a statistical power of 0.8
(80%) would mean that out of 100 different studies, 80 of them would
detect it. Having a high statistical power is vital to ensure that our
experiment has a good chance of detecting the effects we are interested
in. There is a clear relationship between sample size and power, with
larger sample sizes resulting in higher power to detect the same effect.
Conducting a ‘power analysis’ is a good way to assess a reasonable
minimum sample size for your experiment. A full discussion of this is
outside of the scope of this course, but there are links to further
resources in the <a href="additional-resources.html">final

<p>For nucleus number, we will need to count the number of nuclei
present at each timepoint.</p>
<p>For nucleus size, there are many different options. If we’re imaging
in 2D, we could measure the nucleus area, or the width at its widest
point. For 3D, we could measure nucleus volume, or again the width at
its widest point…</p>
<p>For nucleus shape, there are even more options. In 2D we could, for
example, measure the nucleus ‘roundness’ (a measure of how circular it
is). In 3D, we could measure nucleus ‘sphericity’ (a measure of how
spherical it is). Which measures you use will often depend on which
image analysis software you use. Many analysis packages have a wide
range of shape (morphological) features built-in e.g. Napari has a
plugin called ‘napari-skimage-regionprops’ that offers <a href="https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-skimage-regionprops#features" class="external-link">many
different features</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-quantify">How to quantify?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-to-quantify"></a></h3>
<p>Here again there is no one correct answer - a lot will depend on
which image analysis software you use and your personal preference. For
example, let’s say you decided on imaging in 3D and measuring nucleus
number, volume and sphericity with Napari. Before we can make any
measurements from the cells, we first need to ‘segment’ the nuclei
i.e. identify which pixels in the image correspond to each nucleus
(we’ll look at this in detail in later episodes). For some tasks, this
could be as simple as drawing a contour or boundary around the cell.
However, as we are looking to quantify many nuclei at many different
timepoints, it’s not feasible to do this manually - we’ll need to
develop an automated workflow to segment the nuclei and measure their
volume and sphericity. We’ll look at some techniques for this kind of
analysis in the <a href="quality-control-and-manual-segmentation.html">manual
segmentation</a>, <a href="filters-and-thresholding.html">thresholding</a> and <a href="instance-segmentation-and-measurements.html">instance

</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="choose-a-light-microscopy-method">Choose a light microscopy method<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choose-a-light-microscopy-method"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>For the final part of this episode, let’s look at how we can choose a
light microscopy method for our experiment. We’ll look at the last step
(choosing acquisition settings) in the <a href="choosing-acquisition-settings.html">next episode</a>.</p>
<p>Often the first step in choosing a light microscopy technique is
discussing with other members of your research group or department. What
are most of them using, for what kind of experiments? If you are working
with a microscopy core facility, then the people who work there are also
a great source of advice and recommendations. Finally, you can also
explore the literature for research questions and experiments similar to
yours to see which methods are used most often.</p>
<p>There’s a very wide variety of light microscopes available (from many
different manufacturers) that are specialised for different kinds of
samples. We’ll take a brief look at some popular options below, but
there are far too many to cover in a single episode. Bear this in mind
when choosing light microscopy techniques for your own experiments -
there are many more options to consider!</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="widefield">Widefield<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#widefield"></a></h3>
<p>In a widefield microscope, the entire sample is illuminated by the
light source at once. The light source can illuminate the sample from
below (in an upright microscope) or from above (in an inverted
microscope).</p>
<p>In it’s simplest form, a widefield microscope can be used for
‘brightfield microscopy’. This is simply where the sample is illuminated
by a bright light from one side, and then imaged from the other. The
issue with this method is that it often produces low-contrast images,
where it’s difficult to see biological structures. This is because
biological structures are often quite transparent - they don’t absorb
much light or differ much in their density. For this reason, contrast
agents/staining are often used to increase contrast (i.e.  the addition
of dyes/chemicals that bind to specific structures).</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/skin.png" style="width:70.0%" alt="Screenshot of Napari's Skin sample image" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The image above is Napari’s Skin (RGB) sample
image - it is a brightfield image of a hematoxylin and eosin stained
slide of dermis and epidermis.</div>
</figure><p>To increase contrast (especially for unstained samples), widefield
microscopes often support <a href="https://www.microscopyu.com/techniques/phase-contrast/introduction-to-phase-contrast-microscopy" class="external-link">‘phase-contrast’</a>
or <a href="https://www.leica-microsystems.com/science-lab/microscopy-basics/differential-interference-contrast-dic/" class="external-link">‘DIC
- Differential Interference Contrast’</a>. Both these methods make use
of slight changes in the ‘phase’ of light as it passes through a sample
to increase contrast.</p>

</div>
</figure><p>Widefield microscopes can also be used for fluorescence microscopy.
In fluorescence microscopy, fluorescent labels are used that target
specific features (like the nucleus or cell membrane). These labels are
excited by a specific wavelength of light (the excitation wavelength),
and then emit light of a longer wavelength (the emission wavelength). By
illuminating the sample with light of the excitation wavelength, then
detecting light of the emission wavelength, a fluorescence microscope
can image the biological structures that the label is bound to.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that optimising a fluorescence microscopy setup can
be quite complex! For example, depending on the structure you want to
image, it can be difficult to acquire labels that bind specifically and
don’t interfere with normal function and localisation. This requires
multiple initial tests to verify where a label binds, as well as the
appropriate conditions to use (like incubation time / temperature). In
addition, if you want to image multiple fluorescent labels at the same
time, then you have to ensure there is minimal overlap between their
excitation/emission wavelengths. Labels must also be chosen to match the
available lasers/filters on your microscope of choice - otherwise you
will be unable to properly excite and collect emitted light from them.
These considerations are true for all types of fluorescence microscope -
including widefield and also confocal (that will be discussed
below).</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/fluorescence-example.jpg" style="width:70.0%" alt="Fluorescence microscopy image of some LLC-PK1 cells" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The image above is a fluorescence microscopy
image of some LLC-PK1 cells (ZEISS Microscopy, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0" class="external-link">CC BY 2.0</a>, via <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mitotic_LLC-PK1_cells,_fluorescence_microscopy_(23700644352).jpg" class="external-link">Wikimedia
Commons</a> )</div>
</figure><p>The main issue with widefield microscopes is that, due to the whole
sample being illuminated, it can produce rather blurry images
(especially for thicker samples). For example, in widefield fluorescence
microscopy, fluorophores throughout the entire sample will be emitting
light. This means that the resulting image will represent light from the
focal plane, and also from out-of-focus planes above and below it. This
can result in details being obscured by out-of-focus light.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="confocal">Confocal<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#confocal"></a></h3>
<p>Confocal microscopes are capable of ‘optical sectioning’ meaning they
can detect light only from the plane of focus and exclude light from
out-of-focus planes. This is extremely useful, especially for thick
samples, to achieve clear images where details aren’t obscured by
out-of-focus light.</p>
<p>There are many different types of confocal microscopes, but one of
the most common is laser scanning confocal microscopes. These are also
known as point scanning confocal microscopes. In this microscope, a
laser is focused onto a single point of the specimen at a time (rather
than illuminating the entire sample). The point of illumination is then
moved across the sample in a raster pattern (i.e. line by line), with
light detected point by point. This gradually builds up the final
image.</p>
<p>Confocal microscopes are typically used for fluorescence microscopy,
especially when it is necessary to image the shape of structures in full
3D. However, this form of imaging also comes with some disadvantages.
For example, confocal microscopes will generally be more complex to use
and slower to acquire images than a widefield microscope. Although there
are other types of confocal that are faster than laser scanning systems,
such as ‘spinning disc confocal microscopes’. Spinning disc systems
split the laser into hundreds of focused beams using an array of
carefully arranged pinholes on a round disc. Spinning the disc causes
the beams to rapidly scan across the sample and acquire an image, much
faster than using a single beam as a standard laser-scanning confocal
does. For more information, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-0313-9" class="external-link">Jonkman et
al.’s review</a> gives a great summary of different confocal methods -
e.g. see figure 2 for a comparison of laser-scanning and spinning disc
confocals.</p>

</figure></div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="super-resolution">Super-resolution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#super-resolution"></a></h3>
<p>Before the invention of ‘super-resolution’ methods, it was thought
that light microscopes had a maximum resolution of around 200nm due to
the <a href="https://www.microscopyu.com/techniques/super-resolution/the-diffraction-barrier-in-optical-microscopy" class="external-link">‘diffraction
limit’</a> of light. Super-resolution methods allow microscopes to
surpass this limit, achieving resolutions down to tens of nanometres.
This allows many biological structures, previously only visible with
techniques like electron microscopy, to be viewed with light
microscopes. Many of these super-resolution systems are based on
modified widefield or confocal microscope setups. The increase in
resolution they provide usually comes at the cost of increased
complexity in experiment/microscope setup. There are far too many types
of super-resolution to cover in this episode, but <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-018-0251-8_" class="external-link">Schermelleh et
al.</a> and <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2021.0110" class="external-link">Prakash
et al</a> provide useful reviews if you are interested.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="choosing-a-method">Choosing a method<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choosing-a-method"></a></h3>
<p>Choosing a light microscopy method is about finding the simplest and
fastest approach that can address your research question. For example,
does it provide the resolution you need? Can it provide good images of
thick vs thin samples? Does it image a large enough area? Does it image
fast enough to provide the temporal resolution you need?… The online <a href="https://www.bioimagingguide.org/welcome.html" class="external-link">bioimaging guide</a>
provides a <a href="https://www.bioimagingguide.org/02_Sample_acquisition/Picking.html" class="external-link">useful
flowchart</a> to give you some ideas - as well as links to many other
great microscopy resources. We’ve also placed a small summary table
below of the microscopy techniques we covered in this episode.</p>
<p>If your research question can be solved by a simpler and less costly
method, then usually this is the way to go! It’s all about choosing the
right tool for the job - different approaches will be best for different
research questions. For example, you could count cell number with a
high-end super-resolution microscope, but this is also possible with a
standard widefield which will be simpler and faster. In general, only
move to more complex techniques when your research question really
requires it. This also holds true for later steps like choosing image
processing and statistical analysis methods.</p>

<p>Again, there’s no one solution here - it depends on which elements of
nucleus shape and size we’re focusing on. If we’re happy with 2D
measures, then widefield fluorescence microscopy would be a great option
to allow large numbers of nuclei to be imaged over time.</p>
<p>If we’re more interested in the precise 3D volume and shape, then
confocal fluorescence microscopy would be a better fit. We’d have to be
careful with how often we wanted to image the cells vs the speed of
acquisition though.</p>
<p>As we are using live cell imaging, we have to carefully consider how
often we need to take an image to answer our research question. For
example, if we want to track the rapid movement and divisions of
individual nuclei, then we will need to image quickly, with a small time
interval between each image. Alternatively, if we only need to measure
overall changes in mean nucleus number/size/shape (without exactly
tracking every nucleus) then we can allow much longer time intervals
between each image. For rapid imaging, it may be necessary to use a
microscope specialised for high speed (such as a spinning disc
confocal), otherwise slower methods (such as a standard laser scanning
confocal) can also work very well.</p>
<p>Super-resolution options wouldn’t be required here. Cell nuclei can
be easily visualised with standard widefield and confocal approaches, as
they have a large diameter of around 5-20 micrometre (depending on cell
type). This is well above the classic ‘diffraction limit’ of around
200nm that we discussed in the <a href="#super-resolution">super-resolution section</a>. There’s no need
to introduce any extra complexity, as our research question doesn’t
require that level of resolution.</p>
