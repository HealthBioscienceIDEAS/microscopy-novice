<p>In the last episode we looked at some of the main steps to designing
a light microscopy experiment:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li><p>Define your research question</p></li>
<li><p>Define what you need to observe to answer that question</p></li>
<li><p>Define what you need to measure to answer that question</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a light microscopy method that fits your data
needs</p></li>
<li><p>Choose acquisition settings that fit your data needs</p></li>
</ol><p>In this episode, we’ll focus on the last step - choosing acquisition
settings - as well as looking at some early quality control steps.</p>
<section id="acquisition-settings"><h2 class="section-heading">Acquisition settings<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#acquisition-settings"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Once you’ve chosen a light microscope to use, there are a wide
variety of acquisition settings that can be adjusted. Acquisition
settings commonly optimised for an experiment include magnification,
laser power, and exposure time, but there are many others. Different
combinations of settings will be best for different samples and research
questions. For example, one combination of settings may be best for
rapid live cell imaging, while another may be best for high resolution
imaging of fixed samples.</p>
<p>There are many different factors that are affected by acquisition
settings, but here are some of the main ones to consider.</p>
</section><section id="spatial-resolution"><h2 class="section-heading">Spatial resolution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatial-resolution"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Spatial resolution is defined as the smallest distance between two
adjacent points on a sample that can still be seen as separate entities.
In 2D, this is measured in x and y, while in 3D it is measured in x, y
and z. For example, a resolution of one micrometre would mean that
objects less than one micrometre apart couldn’t be identified separately
(i.e. they would appear as one object).</p>
<p>Spatial resolution is affected by many factors including the
wavelength of light and the <a href="https://www.microscopyu.com/microscopy-basics/numerical-aperture" class="external-link">numerical
aperture (NA)</a> of the objective lens. Using a shorter wavelength of
light and higher NA lenses, can provide higher resolution images.</p>
<p>Spatial resolution can be isotropic (the same in all directions) or
anisotropic (different in different directions). Anisotropic resolution
is common with 3D datasets, where the x/y resolution tends to be better
than the z resolution.</p>
<p>We’ll look at spatial resolution in more detail <a href="#resolution-vs-pixel-size">later in this episode</a>.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>In this episode, we use ‘spatial resolution’ to refer to the
resolution limits of the light microscope. Note that sometimes ‘spatial
resolution’ is also used to refer to the final image pixel size (as we

<hr class="half-width"><p>Temporal (or time) resolution, is how fast images can be acquired
(usually measured in seconds or milliseconds). This is mainly controlled
by the ‘exposure time’, which is the length of time over which the
detector collects light for each image. For a laser scanning confocal
microscope, you will instead see a ‘dwell time’ - this is the time the
laser spends illuminating each position on the sample. Decreasing
exposure time / dwell time will result in faster overall imaging
speeds.</p>
<p>The imaging speed will also depend on some of the mechanical
properties of your chosen light microscope. For example, the speed with
which a laser-scanning confocal can move the laser across a sample, or
(if imaging multiple locations) the speed of the microscope stage
movement.</p>
<p>To produce good quality images (with a high signal-to-noise ratio, <a href="#signal-to-noise-ratio">as we’ll look at later</a>), the detector
needs to collect as much light as possible in these short
timescales.</p>
</section><section id="field-of-view"><h2 class="section-heading">Field of view<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#field-of-view"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>The field of view is the size of the area you can view with your
light microscope. It is often measured as a diameter in millimetres. A
larger field of view is useful if you want to, for example, observe a
large number of cells at the same time. This can quickly increase your
sample size, providing improved statistical power (as covered in the <a href="designing-a-light-microscopy-experiment.html#define-what-you-need-to-measure">last
episode</a>).</p>
<p>The field of view is affected by many factors but, importantly, is
directly related to the magnification of the objective lens. Higher
levels of magnification result in a smaller field of view.</p>
<p>To image areas larger than the field of view, you will need to
acquire multiple images at different positions by moving the
microscope’s stage. These images can then be stitched together (often
with the microscope manufacturer’s acquisition software), to give one
large final image. This method can provide high resolution images of
large areas, but also slows down overall acquisition times.</p>
</section><section id="depth-penetration"><h2 class="section-heading">Depth penetration<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#depth-penetration"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Depth penetration refers to the distance light can penetrate into
your sample (in the z direction). It therefore controls the maximum z
range that you can image over - for example, a specific confocal
microscope may be limited to a maximum depth of 50 micrometre.</p>
<p>Depth penetration is limited due to samples absorbing and scattering
light that passes through them. Various factors control the penetration
depth - for example, the density of the sample and the wavelength of
light used during imaging. Various <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-021-00080-9" class="external-link">tissue
clearing</a> methods exist that can help to make a sample more
transparent, and allow imaging at greater depths. Also, the use of
longer wavelengths of light can reduce absorption/scattering and
increase depth penetration. This comes at the cost of decreased spatial
resolution (as we covered in the <a href="#spatial-resolution">spatial
resolution section</a>). For very thick samples, you will likely need to
use a microscope specialised for this task e.g. a <a href="https://www.microscopyu.com/techniques/multi-photon/multiphoton-microscopy" class="external-link">multiphoton
microscope</a>.</p>
</section><section id="data-size"><h2 class="section-heading">Data size<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-size"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>It’s important to consider the overall size of your imaging data
(e.g. in megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB)). Light
microscopy datasets can be extremely large in size, so you will have to
make sure you have appropriate file storage space that is regularly
backed up.</p>
<p>The overall size of your data will depend on many factors. For
example, increasing your resolution will increase the size of your final
images, especially if you are covering a large area by stitching
multiple images taken at different positions together.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Illuminating our samples with light is an essential part of
collecting light microscopy images. However, we must also be mindful of
the detrimental effects light can have on our samples, especially at
high intensity over long time periods.</p>
<p>Photobleaching is a key issue for fluorescence microscopy. If a
fluorophore is exposed to intense light, its structure can degrade over
time. This means that it will eventually stop fluorescing entirely.</p>
<p>Another issue is phototoxicity. Light exposure can damage cells
resulting in unexpected changes in cell behaviour, morphology and
eventually cell death.</p>
<p>Reducing the effects of photobleaching and phototoxicity requires
minimising the light exposure of our samples as much as possible. Light
exposure can be reduced through many methods, including reducing
light/laser power, reducing exposure time/dwell time, and imaging at
lower temporal resolution.</p>
</section><section id="signal-to-noise-ratio"><h2 class="section-heading">Signal to noise ratio<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#signal-to-noise-ratio"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Signal to noise ratio is a very useful measure of image quality - in
general, it will be easier to identify and measure features of interest
in images with a higher signal to noise ratio.</p>
<p>The ‘signal’ is what we really want to measure - for example, for a
fluorescence microscopy image, this would be the light emitted by
fluorophores in the sample. In an ideal world the detector would
perfectly measure the light intensity, but this isn’t really possible.
The values the detector records will always be affected by random
fluctuations called ‘noise’ (see the <a href="#where-does-noise-come-from">‘where does noise come from?’</a>
section for more information). This noise usually appears as a random
‘graininess’ over the image and can make details difficult to see.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/image-with-noise.png" alt="Left - the nuclei from Napari's Cells  (3D+2Ch) sample image. Right - same image with added gaussian noise" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>To identify and measure our features of interest, the absolute size
of the signal and noise are less important than the ratio between them.
For example, imagine we are trying to distinguish between two areas with
different brightness - one being 1.5x brighter than the other. In a low
signal setup where values are small (say 20 vs 30) adding noise can make
these areas very difficult to separate. For example, see the diagram
below which shows three histograms. The left is the ideal scenario,
where there is no noise, and we perfectly see one value of 20 and one of
30. The middle shows the addition of some noise to each value, resulting
in wider distributions that overlap extensively. This means that in the
combined histogram of these values (right) it becomes impossible to
clearly distinguish these two values. Note - here the added noise is a
gaussian distribution centred on each value (i.e. 20 and 30) with a
standard deviation of 10 and 1000 samples - you can read more about
gaussian noise in the <a href="https://bioimagebook.github.io/chapters/3-fluorescence/3-formation_noise/formation_noise.html" class="external-link">noise
chapter</a> of Pete Bankhead’s bioimage book.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/snr-comparison-low.png" alt="Diagram of a low signal-to-noise scenario.  Left - histogram with no noise. Middle - histogram with added noise (separate  histograms). Right - histogram with added noise (combined histogram)." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>If we imagine a scenario with higher signal, now values of 80 and 120
(one still 1.5x higher than the other), then we can see that adding the
same level of noise has less effect. As the values are now higher and
further apart, the broadening of their distributions only causes them to
overlap slightly. We can still clearly distinguish the values in the
combined histogram on the right. This demonstrates how increasing the
signal to noise ratio can improve our ability to recognise and measure
different features.</p>

Right - histogram with added noise (combined histogram)." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>How can we improve the signal to noise ratio of our images? The main
solution is to increase the amount of light that we detect per image, by
adjusting our acquisition settings. For example:</p>
<ul><li>increase light/laser power</li>
<li>increase exposure time / dwell time</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://bioimagebook.github.io/chapters/3-fluorescence/4-microscope_types/microscope_types.html#sec-detectors-binning" class="external-link">binning</a>

<li>Average multiple images</li>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Noise comes from many sources - for example, ‘photon noise’ (also
known as ‘shot noise’) is a key source. Photon noise is caused by
inherent statistical fluctuations in the emission of photons (individual
light ‘packets’). For example, consider a fluorescence microscopy
experiment where photons of light are being emitted from a fluorescent
label. Even though the average rate of emission is constant, the exact
number of photons emitted in a specific time interval (say 30 seconds)
will vary each time. Say 20 photons, then 18, then 22… The exact time a
photon is emitted is random, so there will always be random variations.
These follow a statistical distribution known as a ‘poisson
distribution’ - if you’re interested in the details Pete Bankhead’s
bioimage book has a great chapter on <a href="https://bioimagebook.github.io/chapters/3-fluorescence/3-formation_noise/formation_noise.html" class="external-link">noise</a>.</p>
<p>The important point to consider is that there will always be some
photon noise. It is inherit noise in the emission of light, and
therefore not dependent on a particular microscope or detector
setup.</p>
<p>Other types of noise are dependent on the microscope itself, often
associated with the kind of detector used. For example, ‘read noise’ and
‘dark noise’ are commonly associated with <a href="https://www.microscopyu.com/tutorials/ccd-signal-to-noise-ratio" class="external-link">CCD
(charge-coupled device) cameras</a>. These types of noise relate to
slight inaccuracies in quantifying the number of photons that hit the
detector - no detector is perfect, so there will always be some
variation.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p>In an ideal world we could produce the ‘perfect’ image that optimised
for all of the features above: high spatial resolution, high temporal
resolution, large field of view, large depth penetration, small data
size, low light exposure and high signal to noise ratio. This is never
possible though! There are always trade-offs and compromises to be made.
These different factors are inter-related, usually meaning that
optimising for one will be at the expense of the others. For example,
increasing spatial resolution requires a reduced field of view, and it
will increase the overall data size. As each pixel covers a smaller
area, resulting in less signal per pixel, you will likely need to
increase light exposure to achieve a comparable signal to noise ratio.
This may mean using higher light intensity, or imaging more slowly (with
increased dwell time/exposure time).</p>
<figure><img src="fig/acquisition-tradeoffs.png" style="width:80.0%" alt="Diagram highlighting some of the  trade-offs of increasing spatial resolution" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Different microscopes will provide different ranges for these
features - for example, supporting different ranges of spatial or
temporal resolution, or providing detectors with different sensitivity
that require higher or lower light intensity. Acquisition settings then
allow you to fine-tune how that microscope functions, optimising within
these ranges for your particular sample and research question. For
example, do you need to prioritise temporal resolution for a highly
dynamic process? Or perhaps is spatial resolution the priority, as your
region of interest is very small?</p>

<p>There’s no one correct answer here, as it will depend on which type
of light microscope you are using and which aspects of nucleus size and
shape you want to focus on. Here are some points to consider though:</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="light-exposure">Light exposure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#light-exposure"></a></h3>
<p>As we are interested in how the nuclei number, shape and size changes
over time, we will need to use live cell imaging. Light exposure
(photobleaching / phototoxicity) can be a huge issue for these long
experiments where cells must be exposed to light again and again.
Therefore, to image for as long as possible, we should try to reduce
light exposure as much as possible. This may require using lower
resolution, lower light/laser power and shorter exposure times. We must
balance this against signal to noise ratio though.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-size-and-spatial-resolution">Data size and spatial resolution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-size-and-spatial-resolution"></a></h3>
<p>As we are taking many images over a long timescale, our data size
could become very large. To minimise this, we should make sure we are
using the lowest spatial resolution possible (that still lets us see
individual nucleus size/shape). Usually this means selecting a lower NA
objective lens (which is usually also a lower magnification objective
lens).</p>
<p>Also, we should ensure we are using an appropriate interval between
our images. For example, do you need an image every minute? Or is every
ten minutes fine? Longer intervals will reduce the size of your final
dataset.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="temporal-resolution-1">Temporal resolution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#temporal-resolution-1"></a></h3>
<p>If we are only interested in measuring overall changes in the mean
nucleus number / size / shape, we can afford to have quite large
intervals between our images (low temporal resolution). If we instead
wanted to track the progress of individual nuclei over time (e.g. their
movements and individual divisions), we would need much smaller
intervals (higher temporal resolution).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="field-of-view-1">Field of view<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#field-of-view-1"></a></h3>
<p>We will need to keep the field of view large enough to image many
nuclei at once - this will give us a good estimate of the average nuclei
number / shape / size. This means we should use the lowest magnification
objective lens that still provides enough spatial resolution to see
individual nuclei. Alternatively, we will need to stitch images together
from multiple positions - although this will slow down acquisition, and
must be balanced against the required temporal resolution!</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="depth-penetration-1">Depth penetration<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#depth-penetration-1"></a></h3>
<p>As we are considering cells grown in culture (rather than in thick
tissues), depth penetration isn’t a key concern here. This means we
shouldn’t have to, for example, limit ourselves to fluorophores with
longer emission wavelengths, or require any additional preparation steps
like tissue clearing.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Let’s dive deeper into choosing an appropriate spatial resolution for
your experiment. First, let’s clarify the differences between
magnification, pixel size and spatial resolution.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="spatial-resolution-1">Spatial resolution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatial-resolution-1"></a></h3>
<p>As <a href="#spatial-resolution">defined above</a>, spatial
resolution is the smallest distance between two points on a sample that
can still be seen as separate entities. It is a measure of the
microscope’s ability to resolve small details in an image.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="magnification">Magnification<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#magnification"></a></h3>
<p>Magnification describes how much larger an object appears through the
microscope vs its actual size e.g. 10x larger, 100x larger…</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\large \text{Magnification} =
\frac{\text{Size of object in microscopy image}}{\text{True size of
object}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that this is not the same as spatial resolution! Magnification
just describes how large an object appears, not the size of the details
it can resolve. For example, a particular light microscope may have a
maximum spatial resolution of one micrometre - meaning that it won’t be
able to discern features less than this distance apart. It may be
possible to magnify images far beyond this limit though, making them
appear larger and larger without allowing us to see any more detail.
This is known as ‘empty magnification’ and should be avoided.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="pixel-size">Pixel size<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pixel-size"></a></h3>
<p>We discussed pixel size in the <a href="filetypes-and-metadata.html#pixel-size">filetypes and metadata
episode</a>, but let’s recap here. The pixel size states how large a
single image pixel is in physical units i.e. ‘real world’ units of
measurement like micrometre, or millimetre.</p>
<p>Note again that this is not the same as the spatial resolution! The
pixel size helps us understand how large a region each pixel of our
image covers, but (as with magnification) it doesn’t tell us the size of
details the microscope is really capable of resolving. For example, I
could process a microscopy image to artificially give it 4x as many
pixels as the original. This would reduce the pixel size without
allowing us to see any smaller details i.e. there’s no corresponding
improvement in spatial resolution!</p>

<p>Now that we understand the difference between magnification,
resolution and pixel size - how do we go about choosing their values for
our experiments?</p>
<p>The most important thing is to only use the level of resolution that
you really require to answer your research question. For example, say
you were researching the width of different skin layers using tissue
sections on slides. You could image this at extremely high resolution,
to resolve individual cells and nuclei, but this wouldn’t really be
needed to answer the research question. The width of the larger layers
could be seen at much lower resolution, allowing you to image a larger
area faster, while also keeping your data size as small as possible.
Don’t increase your resolution without a good reason!</p>
<p><a href="#spatial-resolution">As discussed above</a>, a number of
factors affect the spatial resolution - but one of the most important is
your choice of objective lens. Each microscope will usually have a
selection of objective lenses available (each with a different
magnification and numerical aperture (NA)). In general, higher NA lenses
(which provide a higher spatial resolution) will also provide higher
levels of magnification. Choose the lowest NA/magnification objective
that still provides enough spatial resolution to resolve the smallest
structure you want to be able to see and measure. Table 1 of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-0313-9" class="external-link">Jonkman et
al.’s 2020 paper</a> provides a nice summary of some common objective
lenses.</p>
<p>The pixel size of your final image should be matched appropriately to
your chosen objective lens (and therefore the spatial
resolution/magnification used). This is usually set to satisfy ‘Nyquist
sampling’ which states that the pixel size should be two to three times
smaller than the smallest feature you want to capture in your images.
Let’s look at a quick example of why this is necessary.</p>
<p>Consider the diagram below - on the left is shown two round cells
(blue) that have a diameter of 10 micrometre and are overlaid by a pixel
grid with the same spacing. On the right is shown the equivalent final
image, using a rough grayscale colourmap (black = 0, white =
maximum).</p>
<figure><img src="fig/nyquist-1.png" style="width:80.0%" alt="Left - a diagram of two round cells (blue, 10  micrometre wide) overlaid by a perfectly aligned 10 micrometre pixel grid.  Right - the equivalent image with a grayscale colormap" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>When the cells lie at the centre of each pixel, we can easily detect
them as separate objects in our final image. The issue comes when the
cells are offset from the pixel grid - which will happen very regularly
in a real life scenario! Keeping the same 10 micrometre spacing, but
offsetting the grid slightly results in a final image where where we can
no longer separate the two cells:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/nyquist-2.png" style="width:80.0%" alt="Left - a diagram of two round cells (blue, 10  micrometre wide) overlaid by a misaligned 10 micrometre pixel grid.  Right - the equivalent image with a grayscale colormap" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Only by decreasing the pixel size (e.g. to 5 micrometre) can we be
sure to capture the two cells, no matter their alignment with the
grid:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/nyquist-3.png" style="width:80.0%" alt="Left - a diagram of two round cells (blue, 10  micrometre wide) overlaid by a 5 micrometre pixel grid.  Right - the equivalent image with a grayscale colormap" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Failing to meet the Nyquist critera can also result in various image
artifacts known as ‘aliasing’. For example, consider the digram below -
here we have 6 small cells (blue) that are evenly spaced in the x
direction. Using a pixel spacing of 10 micrometre, this produces an odd
effect in our final image, where we see a repeating pattern that is much

Bottom - the equivalent image with a grayscale colormap" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>This is an example of aliasing where a high frequency detail in the
image (the repeating pattern of small cells) is aliased to give a false
lower frequency pattern. Aliasing and Nyquist sampling are important
considerations for all fields where an analog signal is converted to a
digital one - for example, digital audio and video, as well as
images.</p>
<p>Most acquisition software will automatically provide sensible
defaults that meet the Nyquist criteria (taking into account the
configuration of your microscope and other acquisition settings). For
example, for a laser scanning confocal, this will adjust the z-step used
and the x/y spacing of points sampled with the laser. The main point is
to avoid:</p>
<ul><li><p>Undersampling: Our pixel size is too large to accurately preserve
the spatial resolution in the resulting digital image (i.e. we haven’t
achieved Nyquist sampling)</p></li>
<li><p>Oversampling: Our pixel size is too small, exceeding that
required for Nyquist sampling. This results in larger images, with far
more pixels, without providing any extra useful spatial
information.</p></li>

<hr class="half-width"><p>While acquiring your images, it’s good to keep an eye on the image
histogram to ensure your images are good quality. Most light
microscope’s acquisition software will allow you to view a histogram in
real time while imaging your sample. Recall from the <a href="image-display.html">image display episode</a> that histograms
provide a quick summary of pixel values in an image. This summary is a
useful guide to help us adjust acquisition settings like exposure time /
dwell time and laser power.</p>
<p>In an ideal scenario, we want our histogram to show pixel values over
most of the possible intensity range. For example, for an 8-bit image,
spread over most of the range from 0 (minimum) to 255 (maximum). This
will ensure we are capturing as much information as possible about our
sample, and giving ourselves the best chance of distinguishing features
that only differ slightly in their brightness. The exercise below covers
more features to look for in your image histograms, with more details in
the exercise solution.</p>

<p>This image is ‘underexposed’ meaning its pixel values are clustered
at low intensity values, without using much of the intensity range. As
it uses such a small range of pixel values, it will be difficult to
distinguish features of similar brightness.</p>
<p>It could be improved by increasing the amount of light collected -
e.g.  increasing the exposure time / dwell time or increasing
light/laser power.</p>

<div class="section level3">

<p>This image is ‘overexposed’ meaning its pixel values are clustered at
high intensity values. It also shows ‘clipping’ (also known as
‘saturation’), as shown by the very tall peak at the right hand side of
the histogram. Clipping means that some pixels are recording light above
the maximum limit for the image (in this case 255). As no values beyond
this limit can be recorded, they are all ‘clipped’ to the maximum value,
resulting in the abnormally high peak you can see here. Clipping means
that information is being irretrievably lost and should be avoided!</p>
<p>It could be improved by reducing the amount of light collected -
e.g. reducing exposure time / dwell time or decreasing light/laser
power.</p>

<p>This image is exposed well - it has pixel values spread throughout
most of the range from 0-255. Note that you will often have image
histograms with multiple peaks e.g. a low intensity one for the
background and a high intensity one for labelled cells.</p>

<li><p>Magnification describes how much larger an object appears through

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.

    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];

    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
