This lesson provides an overview of the fundamentals of imaging data that has 
been acquired through light microscopy experiments. This course is aimed at all 
researchers who are looking to work with light microscopy imaging data, or to 
refresh their knowledge on some of the key fundamentals.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  prereq

## Prerequisites

- Some prior experience with acquiring/working with light microscopy data would 
be useful, but isn't necessary. This course is aimed at anyone who is looking to 
work with light microscopy imaging data in their research projects.

- No python experience is necessary or assumed, but you will get more out of the 
course if you know some basics e.g. from the online [Software Carpentry 
python course](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) or 
[an in-person course at UCL
](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/education/training).

- Please bring a laptop (Windows, Mac or Linux) to the lesson. Before the start 
of the course, please follow the [setup instructions](learners/setup.md) so 
that your laptop is ready to run the material in the lessons.
